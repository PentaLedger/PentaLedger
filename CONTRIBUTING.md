# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is focused on building reliable, high-quality software. We welcome contributions from anyone willing to engage thoughtfully and focus on improving the project.

## AI-Generated Contributions

You are personally responsible for anything you submit — including content generated with the help of AI tools.

Do not submit:

- AI-generated code that hasn't been fully reviewed and understood by you.
- Hallucinated bug reports, fictional errors, or fabricated references.
- Low-effort or incoherent pull requests clearly generated without care.

If you submit AI-generated content that is misleading, broken, or sloppy, you will be permanently banned.

This project values accuracy, clarity, and technical rigor. If you use AI tools, use them responsibly — as an assistant, not a replacement for understanding.

## What We're Looking For

We welcome:
- Bug reports that are clear, reproducible, and well-documented.
- Feature requests that align with the project's scope and purpose.
- Code contributions that are clean, tested, and improve technical quality.
- Documentation improvements that clarify how the project works.

## Ground Rules

Before contributing, please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This project is technical in nature — political or ideological commentary is not welcome.

We ask all contributors to:
- Focus on the code and the goals of the project.
- Explain the **why** behind changes, not just the **what**.
- Keep discussions productive and technical.
- Accept constructive feedback with professionalism.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and create a branch for your changes.
2. Make your changes in a clean, logical commit history.
3. Test your code and confirm it builds/runs as expected.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear explanation of your changes.

We use conventional pull requests:
- One feature or fix per PR.
- Write concise but informative commit messages.
- Format your code consistently with the rest of the project.

## Submitting Issues

When opening an issue:
- Use a descriptive title.
- Include steps to reproduce if reporting a bug.
- Explain **why** a feature or change is valuable.

## Code Style & Testing

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- Add tests where applicable.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies or complexity.

## Final Note

We’re building something worth maintaining — that means we value correctness, clarity, and performance over flashiness or trendiness. If you're aligned with that mindset, you're in the right place.

Thanks again for taking the time to contribute!
