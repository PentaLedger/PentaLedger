# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This software is currently in pre-alpha development and may have 
substantial security issues.  Use at your own risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue**. Instead, report it to us privately by emailing:

Include as much information as possible:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept (if available).
- The impacted versions.
- Any known workarounds.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge your contribution in our security changelog.

## Response Process

1. We will acknowledge your report within **2 business days**.
2. We aim to investigate and triage the issue within **5 business days**.
3. If a valid vulnerability is confirmed, we will:
   - Work on a fix and validate it.
   - Issue a CVE or security advisory if appropriate.
   - Coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline with you.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure approach:
- We will notify affected users via release notes or security advisories.
- Credit will be given to reporters unless they request otherwise.

## Third-Party Dependencies

Our project may rely on third-party dependencies. We recommend checking their advisories when performing a security audit.
