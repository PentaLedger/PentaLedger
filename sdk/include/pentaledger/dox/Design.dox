/*! \page design Design Information

This page should be the entry point to the design documentation associated with
your component.   All relavent design information, including state charts,
activity diagrams, etc. should be provided here.   Note that Doxygen will generate
the class / collaboration diagrams from the code, so those should be excluded
from this area.   

The audience of this section will be both software engineers as well as product 
engineers.

Note that multiple pages can/should be included in this file.   The remaining
pages were lifted from an existing component and include images, links, etc.
as examples.
