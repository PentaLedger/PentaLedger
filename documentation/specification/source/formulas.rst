Key Performance Metrics (KPIs)
==============================

Current Ratio
-------------
Current ratio is a liquidity ratio that helps you understand whether the business can 
pay its short-term obligations—that is, obligations due within one year— with its 
current assets and liabilities.

.. math::

   Current Ratio = \frac{Current Assets}{Current Liabilities}

Gross Profit Margin
-------------------

Gross profit margin is a profitability ratio that measures what percentage of revenue 
is left after subtracting the cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold refers to
the direct cost of production and does not include operating expenses, interest, 
or taxes. In other words, gross profit margin is a measure of profitability, 
specifically for a product or item line, without accounting for overheads. 

.. math::

   Gross Profit Margin = \frac{Revenue - Cost of Sales}{Revenue * 100}


Earnings Per Share (EPS)
------------------------

To calculate earnings per share (EPS), you take a company's net income, 
subtract any preferred dividends, and then divide that amount by the average 
number of outstanding common shares; essentially, it's the company's 
profit divided by the number of shares available to investors.

.. math::

   EPS = \frac{Net Income - Preferred Dividends}{Average Outstanding Common Shares}

Debt Radio
----------
.. math::

   DPS = \frac{Total Liabilities}{Total Assets} * 100



Dividends Per Share (EPS)
-------------------------

.. math::

   DPS = \frac{Total Dividends over Period - Special Dividends}{Outstanding Shares}

Dividend Yeild
---------------

Dividend yield is calculated from previous dividends paid, it's not a contract of future dividends.

Equity Ratio
------------

Leverage
--------

Financial leverage, also known as the equity multiplier, refers to the use of debt to buy assets. 
If all the assets are financed by equity, the multiplier is one. As debt increases, the multiplier 
increases from one, demonstrating the leverage impact of the debt and, ultimately, 
increasing the risk of the business.

.. math::

   Leverage = \frac{Total Assets}{Total Equity}

Inventory Turnover
------------------
Inventory turnover is an efficiency ratio that measures how many times per accounting period 
the company sold its entire inventory. It gives insight into whether a company has excessive 
inventory relative to its sales levels.

.. math::

   Inventory Turnover = \frac{Cost of Sales}{(Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory / 2)}


Net Profit Margin
-----------------

Net profit margin is a profitability ratio that measures what percentage of 
revenue and other income is left after subtracting all costs for the business, 
including costs of goods sold, operating expenses, interest, and taxes. Net 
profit margin differs from gross profit margin as a measure of profitability 
for the business in general, taking into account not only the cost of goods 
sold, but all other related expenses.

.. math::

   Net Profit Margin = \frac{Net Profit}{Revenue * 100}


Return on Assets (ROA)
----------------------
Return on assets, or ROA, is another profitability ratio, similar to ROE, 
which is measured by dividing net profit by the company's average assets. 
It's an indicator of how well the company is managing its available resources 
and assets to net higher profits.

.. math::

    ROA = Net Profit / (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2

Return on Equity (ROE)
----------------------
Return on equity, more commonly displayed as ROE, is a profitability ratio 
measured by dividing net profit over shareholders’ equity. It indicates how well 
the business can utilize equity investments to earn profit for investors.

.. math::

    ROE = Net Profit / (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2


Total Asset Turnover
--------------------
Total asset turnover is an efficiency ratio that measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue. The higher the turnover ratio, the better the performance of the company.

.. math::

    Total Asset Turnover = Revenue / (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets / 2)

total asset turnover equation: total asset turnover equals revenue divided by (beginning total assets plus ending total assets divided by 2)

Quick Ratio
-----------

The quick ratio, also known as an acid test ratio, is another type of liquidity ratio that measures a business's ability to handle short-term obligations. The quick ratio uses only highly liquid current assets, such as cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivables, in its numerator. The assumption is that certain current assets, like inventory, are not necessarily easy to turn into cash.

.. math::

    Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

Working Capital
---------------

Working capital is a measure of the business's available operating liquidity, which can be used to fund day-to-day operations.

.. math::

    Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
