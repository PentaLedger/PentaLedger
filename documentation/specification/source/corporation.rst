Corporation Governance
######################

This chapter explains how PentaLedger supports the accounting and governance needs of corporations.
It describes how to manage equity, generate cap tables, and store official corporate documents such 
as meeting minutes and bylaws.

Overview
========

PentaLedger includes features specifically designed to support the structure and reporting requirements of corporations.
These include:

- A **stock ledger** to track ownership of common and preferred shares
- An automatically generated **capitalization table (cap table)**
- Storage and indexing of **corporate documents** such as bylaws, resolutions, and meeting minutes
- Planned support for board governance and legal compliance workflows

Use Cases
=========

PentaLedger is suitable for:

- Small to mid-sized C corporations and S corporations
- Startups managing equity and cap tables
- Holding companies with multiple subsidiaries
- Private corporations needing digital corporate records

Stock Ledger
============

The stock ledger records all authorized, issued, and transferred shares for each corporation.
Each entry in the ledger contains:

- **Certificate Number**
- **Shareholder Name**
- **Class of Stock** (e.g., Common, Preferred A)
- **Number of Shares**
- **Issue Date**
- **Transfer History**

All stock issuances and transfers are immutable and timestamped for auditability.

Capitalization Table
====================

The cap table provides a snapshot of company ownership and equity distribution.
It is generated automatically from the stock ledger and includes:

- Total authorized shares
- Shares outstanding by class
- Ownership percentages
- Shareholder names and holdings

Future versions will support scenario modeling for equity dilution, option pools, and convertible notes.

Corporate Document Management
=============================

PentaLedger will include features for managing official corporate records, including:

- **Articles of Incorporation**
- **Bylaws and Amendments**
- **Board Meeting Minutes**
- **Shareholder Resolutions**
- **Stock Purchase Agreements**

Documents may be uploaded and tagged by type, date, and relevance to specific transactions (e.g., stock issuance).

Document access can be restricted by user role, and a version history will be maintained for transparency.

Entity Structure and Roles
==========================

Each corporation in PentaLedger may define:

- A **legal entity profile** with state of incorporation, tax ID, and fiscal year
- **Officers and directors** with assigned roles and responsibilities
- **Shareholders and stakeholders**
- A **registered agent**

These elements help support compliance reporting, recordkeeping, and audit preparation.

Planned Features
================

The following features are planned for future releases:

- Electronic signature support for board and shareholder resolutions
- Annual meeting planning and quorum tracking
- Integrated document retention policy enforcement
- Support for filing corporate actions (e.g., mergers, conversions)

PentaLedger aims to be a complete corporate governance and accounting platform for modern businesses.
