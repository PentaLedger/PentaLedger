Capital Losses and Carryforwards
================================

Tracking of capital losses is generally done outside the journals, with the exception of C corporations that journalize a Deferred Tax Asset using ASC 740 rules. For individuals, carryforwards are a tax attribute tracked in IRS filings (e.g., Schedule D) rather than in accrual accounting.

Capital losses can offset capital gains without limit. If losses exceed gains, up to $3,000 of the excess loss can be deducted against ordinary income (e.g., wages). Any unused loss carries forward to future years without expiration.

Example
-------

Year 1: You incur a $30,000 capital loss and have no capital gains that year. You can deduct:

- $3,000 against ordinary income (e.g., wages).

The remaining $27,000 is carried forward to the next year.

Carryforward to next year: $27,000

Year 2: You realize a $20,000 capital gain. You can use $20,000 of your capital loss carryforward to offset the full gain. That leaves you with:

- $7,000 of loss remaining.
- You can again deduct $3,000 against ordinary income.
- Remaining carryforward = $4,000.

Year 2 Tax Outcome:

- No tax owed on the capital gain (fully offset).
- $3,000 deducted against income.
- $4,000 carried forward to Year 3.
