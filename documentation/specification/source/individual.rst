Debt Management
###############

PentaLedger provides tools to help users track debts and liabilities, assess their financial health, and develop a strategy for paying off debt using proven methods.

Overview
========

This module is designed for both individual taxpayers and small businesses to:

- Track outstanding debts (credit cards, loans, mortgages, etc.)
- Categorize liabilities by type and due date
- Calculate key debt ratios for financial planning
- Generate personalized debt payoff plans using either the **snowball** or **avalanche** method

Supported Debt Types
====================

Users can enter and track a variety of liabilities, including:

- Credit cards
- Personal loans
- Auto loans
- Mortgages
- Business loans
- Lines of credit

For each debt, users can record:

- **Creditor name**
- **Outstanding balance**
- **Interest rate**
- **Minimum monthly payment**
- **Due date**
- **Payment frequency**

Debt Ratios and Metrics
=======================

PentaLedger automatically calculates several financial indicators:

- **Total Interest Paid** (current and projected)

Debt Payoff Plans
=================

Users can choose from two proven strategies:

Debt Snowball Method
---------------------

- Focus on paying off the **smallest balance first**, while making minimum payments on other debts

- Typically results in faster psychological progress

Debt Avalanche Method
