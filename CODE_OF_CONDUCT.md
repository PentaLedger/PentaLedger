# Code of Conduct

This project is focused on building high-quality software through open, honest, and respectful collaboration. We value technical excellence, clear thinking, freedom of speech, and mutual respect. Everyone is welcome to contribute, provided they engage constructively and keep the focus on the work.

## Our Principles

We expect all contributors to:

- Treat others with fairness, respect, and courtesy.
- Prioritize technical quality, accuracy, and clarity in contributions.
- Engage in open, reasoned discussion — especially when there is disagreement.
- Respect the project's purpose and avoid introducing unrelated agendas.

## Freedom of Expression

We support the right to free speech and thoughtful debate. Contributors are encouraged to share their views on technical matters without fear of censorship, provided their communication is respectful and relevant to the project.

## Ideological Neutrality

This project is not a platform for promoting political, racial, or gender-based ideologies. Discussions and contributions should remain focused on solving problems, improving code, and advancing the technical goals of the project. Attempting to inject identity-based agendas into technical discussions will not be tolerated.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following is prohibited:

- Harassment, threats, or personal attacks.
- Disruptive, inflammatory, or off-topic behavior.
- Repeated attempts to politicize the project or push ideological views.
- Publishing private or confidential information without permission.
- Submitting AI-generated bug reports, feature suggestions, or pull requests without personal verification. Submissions that are clearly generated without care — including hallucinated errors, fake references, or incoherent code — will result in an immediate ban. This project values human judgment and technical accuracy over volume or convenience.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you see behavior that violates this code, please contact **joe.turner@infinity-surge.com**. We will take reports seriously and act as necessary, which may include warnings, revocation of access, or banning repeat offenders.
